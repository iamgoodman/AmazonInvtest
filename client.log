Each bar on this grille is polished on all 4 sides; unlike an aluminum grille which only has 1 finished surface. Made of grade 304 stainless steel, the iGrille far surpasses aluminum grilles for protection against oxidation and corrosion. The iGrille will stay polished and shiny looking whereas an aluminum grille may look tarnished and lackluster with time. Size matters! The iGrille is wider and heavier than an aluminum grille for the same application. At a hefty 6mm in width, the iGrille is 50% wider.

The iGrille is a hairline brushed stainless steel grill insert that was made to be different. Only the iGrille has 3D shine. Each bar on this grille is polished on all 4 sides; unlike an aluminum grille which only has 1 finished surface. Made of grade 304 stainless steel, the iGrille far surpasses aluminum grilles for protection against oxidation and corrosion. The iGrille will stay polished and shiny looking whereas an aluminum grille may look tarnished and lackluster with time. Size matters!

The iGrille is a hairline brushed stainless steel grill insert that was made to be different. Only the iGrille has 3D shine. Each bar on this grille is polished on all 4 sides; unlike an aluminum grille which only has 1 finished surface. Made of grade 304 stainless steel, the iGrille far surpasses aluminum grilles for protection against oxidation and corrosion. The iGrille will stay polished and shiny looking whereas an aluminum grille may look tarnished and lackluster with time. Size matters! The iGrille is wider and heavier than an aluminum grille for the same application. At a hefty 6mm in width, the iGrille is 50% wider.
